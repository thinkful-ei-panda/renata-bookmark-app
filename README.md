- [x] See a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

- [x] I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
- [x] Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
- [x] I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
- [x] I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
- [x] Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
- [x] I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
